#	Simple moon landing simulation
Terminal application written in C.

##	general
This small game represents a simple moon landing simulation. It's a terminal game, where you have the control
of your space ship... or not.

You're starting with a space ship and it's your mission to land on the moon (very) smoothy.
There's no implementation of getting off the moon for a later purpose.

It you're smashing on the moon surface, then you're in luck. You've proved, that moles exists on the moon. You! :o)

##	Which OS may run that game?
This application has been built on Linux Mint 20.3 cinnamon. It should also run on any other linux machine,
however, on Windows, MAC, ... it MIGHT run, too.

##	How to build?
Run the makefile to build the application. If everything went well, just launch the application with ./moon_landing_simulation
