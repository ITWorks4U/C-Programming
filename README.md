# C-Programming
First steps and simple samples for learning the C programming language.

This project offers you some programming samples by using the C programming language from beginner to an advanced programmer.
You can find the tutorials on my channel, too, which are in German, however, the programming itself contains the English written implementation.

These samples allows you to learn the C programming language, why C is hard to learn and much harder to master.

Finally, if you've questions, wishes or else, then contact me.

Have fun! (:
